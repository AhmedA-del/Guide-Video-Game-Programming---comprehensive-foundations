# Guide-Video-Game-Programming---comprehensive-foundations
##Prerequisite
Learn the basics of Git and Github:
- Try Git
- How to Use Git and GitHub

There WILL be math. And, it's important. If the thought frightens you, or bores you, or has you thinking "this isn't for me", head to [khan academy ](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
 right now, sign up, and start devoting 30 minutes a day. This is an investment that will pay off. I'm not making this up.
 
 I list a lot of games to clone in this list. I do not mean make the exact same game down to the assets and name and everything. I mean make a game that uses the same mechanics. **Don't get yourself sued for copyright violation**.
 
## Tier 0  Beginner "taste" of Game Programming **JavaScript** based
 
**Important note** - feel free to skip directly to Tier 1 if you're not interested in the "beginner" stuff or want to skip JavaScript and get right to C++.

**Important note** - before you do anything else in this section, take a look at the games in the final part of this Tier. Starting with the first, and ending with the last, keep these games in mind and pause to build one as soon as you've learned enough from the other resources to do so.

**Get familiar with JavaScript (Feel free to skip this and come back and "unskip it" if at any point you feel daunted by what comes later)**
